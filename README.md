# odin-landing-page

A simple HTML and CSS website that was designed following the guidance of a reference image. This was made as part of the Foundations course for the Odin Project.

The website utilises the Flexbox layout in place of the standard Flow layout. This allows items to shift size and to scale according to the amount of space available to them.
